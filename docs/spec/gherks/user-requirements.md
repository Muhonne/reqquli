## 1. Feature Overview

**Feature Name:** User Requirements Management

**Feature Description:** A comprehensive user requirements management system for regulatory compliance development that enables creation, editing, approval, and browsing of user requirements. This feature ensures all user requirements follow proper approval workflows and maintain compliance through controlled revision management.

**Goal:** Enable 100% traceability of user requirements from creation through approval, ensuring all requirements are properly reviewed before implementation .

## 2. Functional Requirements (User Behaviors)

This section uses Gherkin syntax to describe the feature's behavior from the user's perspective. Each scenario acts as a clear, testable requirement.

```gherkin
Feature: User Requirements Management

Scenario: Browse User Requirements
  Given I am a logged-in user
  When I navigate to the user requirements list page
  Then I see a list of all user requirements
  And each requirement displays its ID, title, status, and revision number
  And I can filter requirements by status (draft, approved)
  And I can sort requirements by ID, title, or created date

Scenario: Create New User Requirement
  Given I am a logged-in user
  When I navigate to the user requirements page
  And I click "Create New Requirement"
  And I fill in the requirement title "System Login"
  And I fill in the requirement description with complete details
  And I click "Save"
  Then a new user requirement is created with status "draft"
  And the requirement has revision number "0"
  And the requirement can have traces added separately

Scenario: Approve User Requirement
  Given I am a logged-in user
  And there is a user requirement "UR-1" not in "approved" status
  When I navigate to the requirement details page
  And I click "Approve"
  And I confirm the approval with my password
  Then the requirement status changes to "approved"
  And the revision number increments to "1"

Scenario: Edit Approved User Requirement
  Given I am a logged-in user
  And there is an approved user requirement "UR-1" with status "approved" and revision "1"
  When I navigate to the requirement details page
  And I click "Edit"
  And I modify the requirement description
  And I click "Save Changes"
  Then the requirement status changes to "draft"
  And the revision number remains at "1" (revision only increments on approval, never on edit)
```

## 3. Technical Requirements

This section details the engineering work for each Gherkin scenario. For detailed API specifications, refer to `/docs/spec/openapi/user-requirements.yaml`.

### 3.1 Backend Functionality

**Browse Operations:** Implements filtering, sorting, and pagination for user requirements list as defined in "Browse User Requirements" scenario.

**CRUD Operations:** Handles create, update operations with state management as defined in "Create New User Requirement" and "Edit Approved User Requirement" scenarios.

**Approval Workflow:** Implements secure approval process with password confirmation and revision tracking as defined in "Approve User Requirement" scenario.

**Traceability Management:** Manages trace relationships through traces junction table, allowing many-to-many relationships between requirements.

**Validation Requirements:**
- Title uniqueness and length constraints (as defined in CONTEXT.md business rules)
- Description minimum length requirements (as defined in CONTEXT.md business rules)
- User authentication verification
- Content completeness checks for approval
- Request rate limiting for resource protection

**Business Logic:**
- Draft status on creation with revision 0
- Status reset to draft when approved requirements are edited
- Revision increment only occurs on approval, never on edit
- Traces managed separately through traces table
- Soft delete implementation with deletedAt timestamps

### 3.2 Frontend Functionality

**UI Components:**
- **Requirements List View:** Filterable, sortable table with pagination showing all user requirements
- **Requirement Create Form:** Multi-field form with validation 
- **Requirement Detail View:** Read-only view with full requirement details, showing downstream system requirements that trace from this requirement
- **Requirement Edit Form:** Editable form with change tracking and validation
- **Approval Interface:** Secure approval workflow with password confirmation
- **Trace Management:** Separate interface for managing trace relationships through traces table

**Associated Behavior:** Implements complete CRUD operations with approval workflow and proper state management.

### 3.3 Database Design

**Indexes Required:**
- Primary: `id` (unique) on userRequirements
- Composite: `(status, createdAt)` for filtered sorting
- Composite: `(deletedAt, status)` for soft delete filtering
- Partial: `deletedAt IS NULL` for active records only
- Primary: `id` (unique) on traces
- Composite: `(from_requirement_id, from_type)` on traces for downstream queries
- Composite: `(to_requirement_id, to_type)` on traces for upstream queries


**Soft Delete Implementation:**
- Never physically delete records
- Set `deletedAt` timestamp when deleting
- All queries filter by `deletedAt IS NULL` by default

## 4. Manual Verification Protocol

### Test Case 1: Browse User Requirements
*Maps to "Browse User Requirements" scenario*

1. **Step 1:** Login as user
2. **Step 2:** Navigate to User Requirements page
3. **Step 3:** Verify list displays with proper columns
4. **Step 4:** Test filtering by each status type
5. **Step 5:** Test sorting by different columns

**Expected Result:** List displays correctly with functional filtering and sorting.

### Test Case 2: Create New User Requirement
*Maps to "Create New User Requirement" scenario*

1. **Step 1:** Login as user
2. **Step 2:** Click "Create New Requirement"
3. **Step 3:** Fill all required fields (title and description)
4. **Step 4:** Save the requirement
5. **Step 5:** Verify requirement created with status=draft, revision=0

**Expected Result:** Requirement created in draft status with proper initial values. Traces can be added separately.

### Test Case 3: Approve User Requirement
*Maps to "Approve User Requirement" scenario*

1. **Step 1:** Login as user
2. **Step 2:** Select draft requirement
3. **Step 3:** Click approve
4. **Step 4:** Confirm with password
5. **Step 5:** Verify status="approved" and revision=1

**Expected Result:** Requirement approved with incremented revision.

### Test Case 4: Edit Approved Requirement
*Maps to "Edit Approved User Requirement" scenario*

1. **Step 1:** Login as user
2. **Step 2:** Select approved requirement (with revision=1)
3. **Step 3:** Edit and save changes
4. **Step 4:** Verify status="draft"
5. **Step 5:** Verify revision number remains at 1 (unchanged by edit)
6. **Step 6:** Re-approve the requirement
7. **Step 7:** Verify revision number increments to 2

**Expected Result:** Requirement returns to draft status with revision unchanged, then increments to 2 upon re-approval. Trace relationships remain unchanged in traces table.

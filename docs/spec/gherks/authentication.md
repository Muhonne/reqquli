## 1. Feature Overview

**Feature Name:** User Authentication System

**Feature Description:** A secure authentication system enabling user registration, email verification, and login functionality for the requirements management platform. This feature ensures secure access control with email verification to maintain data integrity and regulatory compliance.

**Goal:** Provide secure, compliant authentication that enables 100% user verification.

## 2. Functional requirements (User Behaviors)

This section uses Gherkin syntax to describe the feature's behavior from the user's perspective. Each scenario acts as a clear, testable requirement.

```gherkin
Feature: User Authentication System

Scenario: User Registration
  Given I am on the signup page
  And I am not currently logged in
  When I enter valid email "user@example.com"
  And I enter full name "John Doe"
  And I enter a secure password
  And I click "Sign Up"
  Then my account is created with unverified status
  And a verification email is sent to "user@example.com"
  And I see a message "Please check your email to verify your account"

Scenario: Email Verification
  Given I have registered but not verified my email
  And I receive a verification email with a valid token
  When I click the verification link in the email
  Then my account status changes to verified
  And I can log in with my credentials
  And I see the main dashboard

Scenario: Successful Login
  Given I have a verified account with email "user@example.com"
  And I am on the login page
  When I enter my email "user@example.com"
  And I enter my correct password
  And I click "Log In"
  Then I am authenticated and redirected to the dashboard

Scenario: Failed Login - Invalid Credentials
  Given I am on the login page
  When I enter email "user@example.com"
  And I enter an incorrect password
  And I click "Log In"
  Then I remain on the login page
  And I see an error message "Invalid email or password"

Scenario: Failed Login - Unverified Account
  Given I have registered but not verified my email
  And I am on the login page
  When I enter my email and correct password
  And I click "Log In"
  Then I see an error message "Please verify your email before logging in"
  And a new verification email is sent

Scenario: Logout
  Given I am logged in
  When I click "Logout" from the user menu
  Then I am logged out
  And I am redirected to the login page
  And my session is terminated
```

## 3. Technical requirements

This section details the engineering work for each Gherkin scenario. For detailed API specifications, refer to `/docs/spec/openapi/authentication.yaml`.

### 3.1 Backend Functionality

**Registration Flow:** Implements secure user account creation with email verification workflow as defined in the "User Registration" and "Email Verification" scenarios.

**Authentication Flow:** Handles login/logout operations with JWT token management and proper session handling as defined in the "Successful Login", "Failed Login", and "Logout" scenarios.

**Validation requirements:**
- Email format validation and uniqueness checking
- Password strength enforcement (as defined in CONTEXT.md business rules)
- Input sanitization for security
- Token validity and expiration handling
- Account verification status checks

### 3.2 Frontend Functionality

**UI Components:**
- **RegisterForm:** Email, full name, password fields with validation
- **LoginForm:** Email and password fields with error handling
- **EmailVerification:** Success/error states for verification flow
- **AuthGuard:** Route protection for authenticated areas
- **UserMenu:** Logout functionality and user info display

**Associated Behavior:** Implements complete authentication flow with proper state management and error handling.

### 3.3 Database Design

**Indexes required:**
- Primary: `id` (unique) on users table
- Unique: `email` (lowercase) on users table
- Unique: `token` on emailVerificationTokens table
- Unique: `tokenJti` on tokenBlacklist table
- Foreign Key: `userId` references users.id on both emailVerificationTokens and tokenBlacklist tables

**Authentication Tables:**
- **users:** Core user account information with email verification status
- **emailVerificationTokens:** Time-limited tokens for email verification with 24-hour expiry
- **tokenBlacklist:** JWT token invalidation for secure logout with automatic cleanup

**Security Implementation:**
- Password hashing with bcrypt before storage
- JWT tokens with configurable expiration
- Email verification tokens with automatic cleanup
- Token blacklist prevents replay attacks

## 4. Manual Verification Protocol

### Test Case 1: Complete Registration Flow
*Maps to "User Registration" and "Email Verification" scenarios*

1. **Step 1:** Navigate to signup page and enter valid registration details
2. **Step 2:** Submit form and verify account creation message
3. **Step 3:** Check email for verification link
4. **Step 4:** Click verification link and confirm account activation

**Expected Result:** User account created, email verified, automatically logged in.

### Test Case 2: Login Security Validation
*Maps to "Successful Login" and "Failed Login" scenarios*

1. **Step 1:** Attempt login with incorrect password
2. **Step 2:** Verify error message and failed attempt logging
3. **Step 3:** Login with correct credentials
4. **Step 4:** Verify successful authentication and dashboard access

**Expected Result:** Failed attempts blocked and logged, successful login grants system access.

### Test Case 3: Session Management
*Maps to "Logout" scenario*

1. **Step 1:** Login successfully and access protected areas
2. **Step 2:** Click logout from user menu
3. **Step 3:** Verify redirect to login page
4. **Step 4:** Attempt to access protected area without re-authentication

**Expected Result:** Session terminated, protected areas inaccessible until re-login.
